During their first spring break in college, Danial and Lily was taking a 
cruises staring from New York to Castaway Cay. During the journey, they 
enjoyed the recreational facilities on the cruise ship. Suddenly, some robbers
took control the ship and orders the captain change the route towards a 
desolated island - the dwarf bay.

When the hijackers of the ship first broadcasted their taking control, an unmanagable chaos spread through out cruise. Every one was up and running, half sacred and half confused. It seemed that over the course of one night, all the workers on the cruise-the custodians, the waiters, attendents, chefs-had disappeared. There was no one knows what on earth is going on. Around afternoon, a dense crowd started to form on the deck. Daniel and Lily, followed everyone to the deck as well. Suddently the crowd parted as several figures wearing army camo and white caps slowly walked to the center. They all carried rifles. Daniel recognized one of them as the bartender, who, like all the other workers on the cruise, went missing until now.
